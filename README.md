# APGS â€“ Automated Parking Gate System

A smart parking gate system designed using Arduino, ultrasonic and IR sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD. It controls car entry, prevents rush, and can be extended to track available parking slots.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- IR Sensor Module
- Servo Motor (SG90)
- LCD Display (16x2) with I2C Module
- 12V Power Supply
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires

## Features
- Automatically opens/closes gate on car detection
- Prevents back-to-back rush via cooldown delay
- IR sensor ensures gate doesn't close while car is under it
- LCD displays real-time system status
- Designed for safe, systematic parking entry
